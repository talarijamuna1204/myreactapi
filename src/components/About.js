             Anime is unlike most American cartoons such as "Batman" and "Spider-Man" which are different from the comics that ran in the daily newspapers. These differences are visible in a number of ways, including the craft of storytelling, the breadth of content, and even the cultural nuances displayed by the characters.

            <div class="modal-body">The word anime — pronounced "ah-knee-may" — is an abbreviation of the word animation. In Japan, the word is used to refer to all animation. However, outside of Japan, it has become the catch-all term for animation from Japan.
            
            Japanese cultural attitudes about sexuality and violence require that certain titles be ranked higher than normal. For example, nudity is handled very casually in Japan; Sometimes a show that is not specifically for adults will contain material that Western audiences may find interesting. </div></div></div>
